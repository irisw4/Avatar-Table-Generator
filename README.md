# Icon-Table-Generator
Webapp that instantly generates HTML that you can copy and paste to display your graphics in a nice, neat, numbered table.

Uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Currently using Bootstrap for the sake of responsiveness.

## Features
- Numbering
- Font size

## To-do
- use this album (https://imgur.com/a/UR9GJ) as a placeholder
- investigate border-collapse: separate; and border-spacing: 5px on the table head tags and see if the numbering cells can be brought inline somehow
